/*
  GIGA_FORWARDER (Dual-Role BLE Bridge)
  -------------------------------------
  SUMMARY
  - Acts as a BLE *central* to an nRF52840 peripheral named "Force Sensing Unit 1".
    * Connects, discovers attributes, and subscribes to a force data characteristic.
    * Reads incoming force strings from the nRF (e.g., "BASE:123.45").
  - Simultaneously acts as a BLE *peripheral* to a second device (e.g., GIGA2).
    * Advertises a custom service/characteristic and forwards received force strings
      by notifying subscribers.

  FLOW
  1) Start BLE, advertise the forward service for GIGA2, and begin scanning for the nRF.
  2) When the nRF is found by name, connect and subscribe to its force characteristic.
  3) When new force data arrives from the nRF, copy it into a buffer.
  4) If a subscriber (GIGA2) is listening, notify it with the buffered data.

  VARIABLE / CONSTANT KEY
  - targetDeviceName      : GAP name of the nRF peripheral to connect to.
  - forceServiceUUID      : (Not directly used here, but documents expected service).
  - forceCharUUID         : UUID of the force data characteristic on the nRF.
  - peripheral            : BLEDevice handle for the connected nRF.
  - forceCharacteristic   : Handle to the nRF force characteristic (subscribed).
  - forwardService (190A) : Local service we advertise for downstream device.
  - forwardCharacteristic : Local notify characteristic used to forward strings.
  - forwardBuffer[50]     : Staging buffer for latest force string.
  - newDataToForward      : Flag indicating buffer holds fresh data to notify.
